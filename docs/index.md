#### Idea behind
Any modern (modular) application development, has to provide standard interfaces to interact.   

* Why not develop a system, takes input with json and manages all the database operations. 

* Keep it real simple - Abstracting data model and keeps away from complex ORM technologies.

* Easily Extensible for the developers.
