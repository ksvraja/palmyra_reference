## Admin Reference

#### REST API - CRUDS  reference

The developer can create tables using their prefered database client such as heidisql or mysql workbench.

The tables should be created with proper primary key, foreign key references. It is recommended to have auto-increment primary keys. For more information refer to the [Concepts](Concepts) guide. 

After creating the tables, invoke the db synchronization action by the URL 

```
URL - http://{host}/palmyra/v1/{database}/dev/db/sync
Method - post
```

On successful synchronization 200 response code will be received.



After synchronization, the configuration tables (zit_xxx) will be populated with schema metadata. The administrator can modify the field  'zit_ci_type.name'  to change the type name. similarly 'zit_ci_fields.attribute' field can be modified to change the field names of the generated types.
